find the node
check if it is:
    - a leaf node
        set node to null

    - node with a single child
        write an advancedFind method that returns the node and its parent reference property
        
        copy the right node
        save the right node as the new parent reference of the deleted node
        OR if there is no parent node, save that node as the root node


    - both children
        scan the right side for the lowest node, keep going left until you stop

        save the lowest node as the new parent reference of the deleted node
        OR if there is no parent node, save that node as the root node
